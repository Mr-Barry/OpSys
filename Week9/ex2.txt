1) To increase ratio of hitting, we have to to reference pages in the reversed order, than they were referenced before. 
For example:
  1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 with frame = 3 will experience only 5 misses


2) At this time sequence 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 with frame = 3 will lead to 8 misses (0 hits). 
So, the worst idea is to put references in the same order.
