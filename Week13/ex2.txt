Avoid deadlocks through recovery is the easiest way to avoid deadlocks. Howewer, it is might be slower. There is 3 types of recovery

- Rollback: process that holds the resource backing up to the point in time when it haven't claimed resource.
It is slow, but efficient method.
- Preemption: is you can take a resource from its current owner and transfer it to another process, this method could be used.
Howewer, it is usually very difficult method due to the difficulty of determining from which process we can take the resource.
- Killing processes: the easiest way to break the deadlock. But, the process losing eerything it just did, so that causes time losses.

Prevention:
Almost impossible, but (in theory) efficient method. Requires many info about processes and their requests before execution. 

Avoidance:
Almost impossible, since it requires many information about processes.
